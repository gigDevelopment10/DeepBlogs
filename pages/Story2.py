st.markdown('Auto-grad is an automatic **differentiation library** for gradient computation in Python programming language. It is used in machine learning and deep learning to efficiently calculate the **gradients (derivative)** of functions with respect to their input parameters, which is used in optimization algorithms to update the parameters in the direction that reduces the loss.')

st.markdown('To put this in simple words **Auto-grad influences back-propagation** (You can say a mathematical model that trains the neural parameter) and helps to efficiently evaluate the gradient of some kind of loss function that influences the weight of a neural network to learn a feature.')

st.markdown('It is meant to automatically calculate the **derivatives of a function**, freeing the user from the manual and error-prone calculation of derivatives, making it easier to implement complex models and perform optimization.')

st.markdown('Neural networks are hungry for an **autograd engine** because the computation of gradients can be time-consuming and complex, especially for deep neural networks with many layers. An autograd engine takes care of this computation, allowing the user to focus on defining the architecture of the network and the training process. The autograd engine also enables the efficient implementation of different optimization algorithms, making the training process more efficient and easier to implement.')

st.subheader('In summary, an autograd engine is crucial for the successful training of neural networks, and this is why neural networks are hungry for an autograd engine.')
